#About
Phokal is simply about connecting local photographers with clients all across the nation from LA, to New York.

Have you ever tried to find a close to home photographer for an event, wedding, or reunion?
It can be a bit frustrating and time consuming to say the least.
Phokal cuts down on that time spent scouring numerous search pages, white page listings, and tracking down friends and family members to conscript them to the task!

Are you a photographer that is looking at broadening your buisness scope and customer base?
You have found the place!
In this space you will have the freedom to have a page for yourself and a sampling of your work for customers to view.
In addition to that, a portal will be available for you to link with your patrons
